# quantifying-RNA-isoforms
A project done for my bioinformatics class for taking a set of input RNA data (100 mil bp) and using ElasticNet to quantify isoforms in genes.

DISCLAIMER:

Input data was not created by me. It belongs to the department/class but is provided for context. Starter code was provided but portions have been altered by me. All other code is my own.
